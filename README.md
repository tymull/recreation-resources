# recreation-resources
 Healthy recreation resources for BYU students. This was a project for C S 356 that was alright to keep public. The purpose of this project was to practice designing an effective information architecture. To save time, I stubbed out a lot of the content on the different pages, but it still shows the general idea. 

 ## Methodology

 We performed contextual inquiries to find what our target users found important about the topic as well as motivations and obstacles to inform useful content curation and design. After an initial design based off of our best guess for the information architecture, we performed Card Sorting studies with target users to gain insight on how they would organize the content, and the result of that study influenced the current structure of the site.
